üóÉÔ∏è Inventory Management System ‚Äì Java Swing Project
This Inventory Management System is a robust and user-friendly desktop application developed using Java Swing in Apache NetBeans, with MySQL as the backend database and iText for generating professional PDF bills. It is designed to help small to medium businesses efficiently manage their inventory and billing processes.

The system includes key features such as adding, editing, deleting, and viewing product details. Users can categorize products, manage individual item records, and monitor available stock levels. The system also allows users to update existing product data and remove outdated entries, ensuring the inventory database remains accurate and up-to-date.

A key highlight of this system is the ability to generate and print PDF bills for customer purchases using the iText library. This helps maintain a clean digital and printable record of transactions. The PDF generation includes dynamic content like product name, quantity, unit price, total price, and date of transaction, formatted professionally.

The GUI is developed using Java Swing, providing a responsive and intuitive interface that simplifies the user experience. Form inputs, tables, and buttons are organized clearly to allow smooth navigation and interaction.

Database operations such as insert, update, delete, and fetch are handled using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The integration with MySQL ensures that all data is stored securely and can be accessed efficiently.

Developed entirely in Apache NetBeans, this project demonstrates key concepts such as object-oriented programming, GUI design, event handling, file I/O, and database connectivity. It serves as a complete solution for real-time inventory tracking, billing, and product management.

This project is ideal for students, small businesses, and academic demonstrations where end-to-end functionality of inventory control and billing is essential.
